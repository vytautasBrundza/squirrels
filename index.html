<h1>Red squirrels need your help!</h1>
<p>The red squirrel is at risk. Without action it will become extinct in England within a decade. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish red squirrel populations are also endangered.</p>
<p>If we do not take urgent steps to address the issue, the red squirrel will disappear from the UK within a generation.</p>
